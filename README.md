# Project Description & Features

Cornucopia provides an ingredient to recipe pairing service. Upon entry, visitors have two choices 
-- Search the recipe database
-- Login and have the contents of their Pantry paire to recipes that include those ingredients. 

Every receipe search renders a list of recipes that include your search item. 
Every recipe will render a complete list of the needed ingredients and an image when the image is clicked.

Note this application uses one major APIs (Edamam) and several supporting frameworks (mySql, Materialize, jQuery, xxxx).The application state is managed through browser sessionStorage and mySql.


## Getting Started

## Prerequisites
A modern browser and an internet connection. Chrome works best, but others should work fine.  
A modern IDE - it was developed using Visual Studio Code, but any text editor should work, including notepad.  
GitHub

4. Run schema in mySq
5. Open server.js in bash terminal
6. Open local port 3000 in your favorite browser - this will display the website
